# Get Started in InfoSec

The main reason for repo is so I don't forget what cool resources, individuals, tools, and companies are out there. The InfoSec world is too big to remember the best courses, books, people, and things to know, so as you experiment and connect, you'll find what works for you and what doesn't (provided you put in reasonable time and effort). I don't get paid for referencing any of these, still take everything with a grain of salt. If something doesn't work for you, move on to the next thing (again, provided you actually tried by putting in a reasonable amount of time, effort, and focus).
